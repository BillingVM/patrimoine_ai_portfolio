What is the current value of my portfolio?

To calculate the current value of your portfolio, I will use the provided real-time market data. Based on the Investment Holdings Summary, I will extract the relevant information:

Apple Inc. (AAPL) - 100 shares
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) - 50 shares
Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) - 35 shares
McDonald's (MCD) - 5 shares
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) - 60 shares
Using the current stock prices:

AAPL: $272.36
MSFT: $486.85
GOOGL: $314.35
MCD: $310.84
JNJ: $205.78
I will calculate the current value of each holding:

Apple Inc. (AAPL): 100 shares x $272.36 = $27,236.00
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT): 50 shares x $486.85 = $24,342.50
Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): 35 shares x $314.35 = $10,992.25
McDonald's (MCD): 5 shares x $310.84 = $1,554.20
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): 60 shares x $205.78 = $12,346.80
The total value of your portfolio is:
$27,236.00 + $24,342.50 + $10,992.25 + $1,554.20 + $12,346.80 = $76,471.75

Please note that this calculation is based on the provided real-time market data and may not reflect any additional fees, taxes, or other factors that may affect the actual value of your portfolio.

As for the next steps, I recommend reviewing your portfolio's diversification and considering rebalancing if necessary. You may also want to consider monitoring the performance of individual stocks and adjusting your holdings accordingly. However, without more information about your investment goals and risk tolerance, it's difficult to provide more specific advice. If you'd like, we can discuss your investment objectives and create a more tailored plan.
